# digitalcharactersheet
A minimalistic easy to use modular and beginner friendly online character sheet design for Dungeons and Dragons.

I created this for my beginner D&D party because I wanted them to be able to:
  1. Have a clean and simple overview of their character sheets;
  2. Not worry about keeping a crumpled up piece of paper;
  3. Read about and understand their abilities and items without having to hunt for information online.

**Before the first session after implementing this to my table, my players told me that they finally understand what the hasty notes on their physical charactersheets meant.**

My first goal was education of my players but I also kept in mind that sheets change often and they need to be unified and modular if I don't want to rewrite the whole code for every new character or level-up. Anyone with basic technical knowledge can follow the clear comments to create a personalised character sheet for any Wizard, Rogue or Monk. *Other DnD classes can easily be coded in due to the modular nature of this project, I just personally dont have the need for it.*

The website is desktop first, but very mobile friendly.

The base code was written by AI, I cleaned it up and made it modular.

# How I host this for free for my players
I made a free Netlify account and gave it access to my private repo of my characters. It can be set up by anyone with a YouTube tutorial in under 5 minutes.
